Data from the Galton height dataset. Preprocessed and trained models with scikit-learn pipelines. Fine-tuned model using grid search. 

## Code

Feel free to explore the ```model/offspring_height_project.ipynb``` notebook's contents, as it is well-documented with explanations for most aspects of the model-building process.

The ```web``` folder contains code for a Flask web API. It is not deployed.
