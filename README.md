# offspring height model
Ridge regression model for predicting offspring height.

Data from the Galton height dataset. Preprocessed and trained models with scikit-learn pipelines. Fine-tuned model using grid search. Feel free to explore the ```model/offspring_height_project.ipynb``` notebook's contents, as it is well-documented with explanations for most aspects of the model-building process.

The ```web``` folder contains code for a Flask web API. It is not deployed, as I already have two application deployed and deploying isn't free.
